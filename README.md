# Minion Translator

## @neogcamp

Do you know minion language? Checkout this translator to understand minion banana language, bababa babanana...

This repo contains source code for my mark6 project hosted at [minion.jsuryakt.codes](https://minion.jsuryakt.codes).

I used [Fun translations API](https://funtranslations.com/api/#minion) to convert input text to minion banana language.
